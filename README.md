Problem Statement:  Our Sourcing team needs to get a list of companies working on specific domains (web development, mobile app development, react, etc.). But the manual lookup for the same becomes tedious and time-consuming. If they are provided with CSV/excel files of the firms with all the details then it may help them save a significant amount of time. For that, we need you to write a python script that can scrape data from this website (https://clutch.co).

Before running 'main.py' you need to install:
->pip install beautifulsoup4
->pip install csv(if not installed)
->pip install requests(if not installed)

I recommended you to run the file in cmd prompt for better experience, i'd not created GUI soo..

You can choose the domain on which you want the data
You can choose the number of record to be added into the file
Remember every time you run the program it will create new file or overwrites the existing file
Go ahead and run
